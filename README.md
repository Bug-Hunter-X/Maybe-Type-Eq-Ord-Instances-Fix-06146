This repository contains a Haskell code example demonstrating an uncommon error related to defining Eq and Ord instances for the Maybe type. The bug lies in the implementation of the Eq and Ord instances, which cause unexpected behavior when comparing Maybe values of different underlying types.  The solution demonstrates the correct implementation and highlights the importance of type safety in Haskell.
